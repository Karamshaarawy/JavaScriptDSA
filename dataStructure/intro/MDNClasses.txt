-Classes are a template for creating objects.
-They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
-Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

** Defining classes:
- Classes are in fact "special functions"
- A class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.

** Class body
- The body of a class is the part that is in curly braces {}. This is where you define class members, such as methods or constructor.

- The body of a class is executed in strict mode even without the "use strict" directive.

- A class element can be characterized by three aspects:

- Kind: Getter, setter, method, or field
- Location: Static or instance
- Visibility: Public or private

Together, they add up to 16 possible combinations. To divide the reference more logically and avoid overlapping content, the different elements are introduced in detail in different pages:

- Method definitions
Public instance method

- getter
Public instance getter

- setter
Public instance setter

- Public class fields
Public instance field

- static
Public static method, getter, setter, and field

- Private properties
Everything that's private.

In addition, there are two special class element syntaxes: constructor and static initialization blocks, with their own references.


** constructor:
- The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. 
- There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class 
â€” a SyntaxError is thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.
- A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of the super class.
- You can create instance properties inside the constructor.


** Methods
- Methods are defined on the prototype of each class instance and are shared by all instances.
- Methods can be plain functions, async functions, generator functions, or async generator functions. 


** Static methods and fields:
- The static keyword defines a static method or field for a class.
- Static properties (fields and methods) are defined on the class itself instead of each instance.
- Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.
- Static fields are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data that doesn't need to be replicated across instances.
- if your instance properties' values do not depend on the constructor's arguments, you can define them as class fields.
- Class fields are similar to object properties, not variables, so we don't use keywords such as const to declare them.
- In JavaScript, private properties use a special identifier syntax, so modifier keywords like public and private should not be used either.
- The fields can be declared with or without a default value.
- Fields without default values default to undefined.
- By declaring fields up-front, class definitions become more self-documenting, and the fields are always present, which help with optimizations.


** Private properties:
- It's an error to reference private fields from outside of the class; they can only be read or written within the class body.
- By defining things that are not visible outside of the class, you ensure that your classes' users can't depend on internals, which may change from version to version.
- Private fields can only be declared up-front in a field declaration. They cannot be created later through assigning to them, the way that normal properties can.


** Inheritance:
- The extends keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another constructor.
If there is a constructor present in the subclass, it needs to first call super() before using this. The super keyword can also be used to call corresponding methods of super class.
