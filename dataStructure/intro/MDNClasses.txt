-Classes are a template for creating objects.
-They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
-Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

** Defining classes:
- Classes are in fact "special functions"
- A class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.

** Class body
- The body of a class is the part that is in curly braces {}. This is where you define class members, such as methods or constructor.

- The body of a class is executed in strict mode even without the "use strict" directive.

- A class element can be characterized by three aspects:

- Kind: Getter, setter, method, or field
- Location: Static or instance
- Visibility: Public or private

Together, they add up to 16 possible combinations. To divide the reference more logically and avoid overlapping content, the different elements are introduced in detail in different pages:

- Method definitions
Public instance method

- getter
Public instance getter

- setter
Public instance setter

- Public class fields
Public instance field

- static
Public static method, getter, setter, and field

- Private properties
Everything that's private.

In addition, there are two special class element syntaxes: constructor and static initialization blocks, with their own references.


** constructor:
- The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. 
- There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class 
â€” a SyntaxError is thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.
- A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of the super class.
- You can create instance properties inside the constructor.
