-Classes are a template for creating objects.
-They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
-Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

** Defining classes:
- Classes are in fact "special functions"
- A class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.
